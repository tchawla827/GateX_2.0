# GateX Gate Outpass Management System

**GateX** is a facial recognition-based Gate Outpass Management System tailored for college campuses. Students can request outpasses, mark their departure and return using a facial recognition system, and track their request history. Admins manage approvals, view the status of currently out students, and access historical records.

This project, built with Python, Flask, OpenCV, and Firebase, streamlines gate management by replacing manual processes with automation, ensuring security and accuracy.

## Introduction

Manual gate management can be cumbersome, time-intensive, and error-prone. GateX leverages facial recognition to automate and secure the process. Students submit outpass requests, which admins approve or reject. Once approved, students can mark themselves out or back in with a facial recognition-based verification.

The system tracks student movements, maintains history logs, and ensures adherence to campus policies.

---

## Features

GateX offers the following features:

1. **Facial Recognition-Based Marking**:  
   Mark "out" and "in" times using advanced face recognition.

2. **Outpass Request System**:  
   Students can request permission for leaving the campus, providing required details like date, time, and reason.

3. **Admin Panel**:  
   Review and approve/reject requests.  
   View students currently out.  
   Access comprehensive history logs.

4. **Student Dashboard**:  
   Track request history.

5. **Data Integrity**:
   Firebase Realtime Database ensures instant data updates, while Cloudinary stores uploaded images securely.

6. **User Roles**:  
   Distinct functionalities for admins and students.

7. **Responsive Web Interface**:  
   A user-friendly interface built with Flask.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tchawla827/GateX.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Ensure Python 3.11 is installed.
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install dependencies using the provided wheelhouse so `dlib` does not
     need to compile:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade pip
     pip install --find-links wheelhouse -r requirements.txt
     ```
     The versions in `requirements.txt` are final. No additional monkey
     patches are required.

3. **Configure Firebase & Cloudinary**:
   - Set up Firebase for the real-time database.
   - Sign up for [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and obtain your **Cloud name**, **API key**, and **API secret**.
  - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate the values for `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON`, `FIREBASE_DB_URL`, and the Cloudinary variables.
  - The value of `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` should be the entire Firebase service account JSON and must **not** be committed to version control.
  - If the `private_key` contains newlines, represent them as `\n` in the `.env` file.
  - (Optional) Set `TEACHER_PASSWORD_HASH` to override the default teacher
    password.  The application falls back to `admin123` if this variable is not
    provided.

4. **Download Face Landmark Model**:
   - Download: [shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2](https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models/raw/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)
   - Extract and place `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` in the `detection/` folder.

5. **DeepFace Weights from Hugging Face**:
   - On first run, DeepFace downloads the FaceNet weights from the
     [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/).  The files are cached in the
     directory referenced by the `DEEPFACE_HOME` environment variable
     (defaults to `~/.deepface`).
   - To avoid network access at runtime you may pre-download the weights with:
     ```bash
     python - <<'EOF'
     from deepface.basemodels import Facenet
     Facenet.loadModel()
     EOF
     ```
    The weights will be stored in the cache directory for future runs.

6. **Generate a Self-Signed Certificate**:
   - Install [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and run:
     ```bash
     mkcert <your-host>
     ```
     Replace `<your-host>` with the domain or IP you plan to use. This creates
     `<your-host>.pem` and `<your-host>-key.pem` in the current directory.
   - Rename or copy them to `cert.pem` and `key.pem` in the project root.
     Alternatively, use OpenSSL:
     ```bash
     openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -x509 -days 365 \
       -subj "/CN=<your-host>" \
       -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
     ```
7. **Install Node Dependencies & Build Tailwind CSS**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build:css
   ```

8. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   gunicorn -k eventlet -w 1 -b ${HOST:-0.0.0.0}:${PORT:-5000} app:app
   ```
   Set the `HOST` and `PORT` environment variables to control where the server
   binds. When deploying publicly, run behind an HTTPS termination proxy (such
   as Nginx or Caddy) and forward requests to the Gunicorn instance.
   These variables can also be stored in a `.env` file for convenience.

---

## Docker

To build and run GateX using Docker:
```bash
docker build -t gatex .
docker run -p 5000:5000 \
  -e PORT=5000 -e HOST=0.0.0.0 gatex
```
The container now starts the application with **Gunicorn** using the
`eventlet` worker so WebSocket communication works out of the box.

You can also customise these options via the provided `docker-compose.yml`
or by creating a `.env` file (see `.env.example`) with your preferred `HOST`
and `PORT` values.

## Usage

### Students
- Submit outpass requests.
- Mark out/in using facial recognition.

### Admins
- Approve or reject outpass requests.
- Monitor current out status and view history.
